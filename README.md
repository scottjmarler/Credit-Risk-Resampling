## Credit Risk Resampling

Credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. For this project I used various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. Using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, I built a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
